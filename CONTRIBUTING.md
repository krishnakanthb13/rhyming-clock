## Coding Guidelines

-   **HTML/CSS/JS**: Please keep the "One File" structure (`rhyming-clock.html`) unless the change is significant enough to warrant splitting.
-   **Style**: Match the existing coding style (4 spaces indentation, comments for complex logic).
-   **Performance**: Keep the app lightweight. Avoid heavy libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.).
-   **Compatibility**: Ensure the changes work on Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge).
